# CLAUDE.md — TAQINOR OS

The rules below come from the founder and are enforced. They override default
assistant behavior. When a rule references a system that does not exist in this
repo yet, the rule still applies to any future integration.

## Non-negotiable rules

1. **Odoo — JSON-2 API only.** All writes to Odoo go through its JSON-2 API.
   Never write to the Odoo database with SQL, under any circumstances.
   (No Odoo integration exists in this repo today; the rule binds any future one.)

2. **Pipeline stage names come from `STAGES.py` — never hardcoded.** Import the
   canonical stage names from `STAGES.py` at the repo root in backend, frontend
   build constants, scripts, and tests. Do not introduce new hardcoded stage
   lists anywhere. CI runs `scripts/check_stages.py` on every push and fails on
   divergence. `STAGES.py` now exists; the canonical 6 keys are NEW, CONTACTED,
   QUOTE_SENT, FOLLOW_UP, SIGNED, COLD (French UI labels live in the same file).
   Do NOT invent or rename stages; ask the founder.
   FUTURE INTENT: the pipeline stage is NOT wired to any table yet. It will live
   on a new CRM `Lead`/`Opportunity` model, to be built in a future session
   together with the new quote engine. Build nothing for it now. This funnel
   stage is a separate, permanent layer from the quote/invoice *document*
   statuses (rule #4) — the two never merge.

3. **Meta Ads CLI — campaigns are born paused.** Any campaign creation through
   the Meta Ads CLI must always carry `--status PAUSED`. Never create an active
   campaign programmatically. (No Meta Ads code exists in this repo today.)

4. **`/proposal` is the only path for client-facing quote PDFs.** Do not add or
   keep alternative code paths that render or deliver quote PDFs to clients.
   KNOWN CONFLICT: the `ventes` app currently generates devis PDFs via its
   `generer-pdf` endpoint; the founder is replacing the quote engine — until
   that swap lands, do not extend the ventes PDF path, only maintain it.
   STATUS PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT: the new quote engine must preserve or
   explicitly map the existing document statuses — Devis (`brouillon`, `envoye`,
   `accepte`, `refuse`, `expire`), and the downstream BonCommande/Facture
   chains. These document statuses are a separate, permanent layer from the
   `STAGES.py` funnel (rule #2) and must survive the swap. The mapping is
   tracked in `docs/quote-engine-swap-map.md` — update it before the swap.

5. **Scraper policy.** Scrapers must never run from personal accounts. Any
   scraping with Terms-of-Service risk requires BOTH: (a) a risk file committed
   under `tos_risk/` describing target, risk, and mitigation, and (b) explicit
   manual approval from the founder before the first run.

## Repo facts

- Active development happens on `dev`. `main` receives merge commits via PR —
  always a merge commit, never squash, so authorship history is preserved.
- Backend: Django at `backend/django_core` (apps: authentication, stock, crm,
  ventes, reporting, parametres, roles, contact) + FastAPI AI service at
  `backend/fastapi_ia` (OCR via Zhipu AI, natural-language SQL agent via
  LangChain). Frontend: React/Vite at `frontend`.
- Multi-tenant: all business data is scoped by `authentication.Company`. New
  models need a `company` FK; new viewsets must filter querysets by
  `request.user.company` and force-assign `company` in `perform_create` —
  never accept it from the request body.
- Run tests: `python manage.py test apps` (inside the django_core container or
  with env vars pointing at a local Postgres).
- Full stack: `docker compose up` (nginx :80, Postgres+pgvector, Redis, MinIO,
  Celery, Django, FastAPI, frontend). Copy `.env.example` to `.env` first.
- Key-gated features (work only with API keys in `.env`): OCR (`ZHIPU_API_KEY`),
  chatbot/SQL agent (`GROQ_API_KEY` or alternative), outbound email/contact
  form delivery (`SENDGRID_API_KEY`; defaults to console backend locally).
